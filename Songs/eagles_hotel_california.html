<a rel="Bm" class="chord">Bm</a>                                  <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
<a rel="A" class="chord">A</a>                             <a rel="E" class="chord">E</a>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                                   <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
<a rel="Em" class="chord">Em</a>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
<a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
I had to stop for the night
<a rel="Bm" class="chord">Bm</a>                                          <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
<a rel="A" class="chord">A</a>
And I was thinking to myself
<a rel="E" class="chord">E</a>
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                                 <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
<a rel="Em" class="chord">Em</a>
There were voices down the corridor
<a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
I thought I heard them say

<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                      <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
"Welcome to the Hotel California
<a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
Such a lovely place, such a lovely place
<a rel="Bm" class="chord">Bm</a>
Such a lovely face
<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                             <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
<a rel="Em" class="chord">Em</a>
Any time of year, any time of year
<a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
You can find it here"

<a rel="Bm" class="chord">Bm</a>                                   <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends
<a rel="A" class="chord">A</a>                                                  <a rel="E" class="chord">E</a>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                                               <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
<a rel="Em" class="chord">Em</a>                                    <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
<a rel="Bm" class="chord">Bm</a>                                   <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"
               <a rel="A" class="chord">A</a>                                          <a rel="E" class="chord">E</a>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                                            <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
And still those voices are calling from far away
<a rel="Em" class="chord">Em</a>
Wake you up in the middle of the night
<a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
Just to hear them say

<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                      <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
"Welcome to the Hotel California
<a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
Such a lovely place, such a lovely place
<a rel="Bm" class="chord">Bm</a>
Such a lovely face
<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                             <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
<a rel="Em" class="chord">Em</a>
Any time of year, any time of year
<a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
You can find it here"

<a rel="Bm" class="chord">Bm</a>                           <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
                     <a rel="A" class="chord">A</a>                                         <a rel="E" class="chord">E</a>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                                         <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
<a rel="Em" class="chord">Em</a>                                               <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast
<a rel="Bm" class="chord">Bm</a>                             <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
<a rel="A" class="chord">A</a>                                          <a rel="E" class="chord">E</a>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
<a rel="G" class="chord">G</a>                                       <a rel="D" class="chord">D</a>
"Relax," said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
<a rel="Em" class="chord">Em</a>                                                <a rel="F#" class="chord">F#</a>
You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave!"
